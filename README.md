# (Hello I love, you want you tell me your name?)
#  This program likes the song by Jim Morrison & the Doors and borrows a few lines from their hit song.


print('Hello I Love you,')
print('Want you tell me your name?') # ask for their name
myName = input()
print('Its is good to meet you, ' + myName)
print('The length of my name is:')
print(len(myName))
print('What is your age?') # ask for their age
myAge = input()
print('You will be ' + str(int(myAge) + 1) + ' in a year.')
print('It\'s rude to ask for someones age, Python3 knows!')
print('I blame my programmer and his lack of skills!')
print('However he does have good taste in music!!')
